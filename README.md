## OpenCnC
This is an open source WOLv2 emulator for Command and Conquer. It was originally created as a personal experiment to learn more about [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Overall, this implementation isn't much different from other emulators such as PvPGN (minus the Blizzard overhead). Ladder support and User creation are WOL API wrappers for the [wol-ladder](https://github.com/sean3z/wol-ladder) project.
